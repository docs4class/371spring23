# NFL Data

Please make sure you can load and use the NFL data.  You can get the data from:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016?resource=download  

I have also put the data on Brightspace if that helps you.

For Friday, please try to answer these questions:

- Which game had the most plays?  
- How many plays? 
- Which teams played in this game?  
- How many plays if you remove the "No Play" plays?
- Highest scoring game (total points including both teams)?  
- How many plays were in this game?

## Additional practice


1.  Create a new small data set called `small` that only uses game_id's that are less than 2010000000 and the variables game_id, home_team, total_home_score, away_team, total_away_score, and play_type.  How many rows do you get in this data set?  I get 41,880.

2. How many plays are in the game 2009111507?  I get  167.

3.  For `small` how many plays are kick offs?  I get  2327.

4. For game 2009111507 how many plays are kick offs? I get 10.

5.  For `small` how many plays are qb kneels or qb spikes? I get 425.

6.  For `small` how many what is the percentage of run to pass plays excluding all other types of plays?  I get 43.15482% running. 

7. In small, which game has the most passing plays?  I get game 2009122006 with 101 passing plays.
