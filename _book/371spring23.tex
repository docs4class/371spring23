\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

This is a book written which contains all the materials and lessons for \textbf{BADM 371 Intro to Data Analytics}. If you miss a day, want to review something we covered in class, or for any reason want to look for a worksheet, this is where you can go.

Each chapter contains a different topic we will cover during the semester. Some larger topics are split into two chapters to make accessing the materials a little more intuitive.

This book is updated automatically with any changes made to the documents during the semester, so if at any point you are told there was a change in the assignment, you can come here to get the updated version.

Also, this book has benefited greatly from lots of free, readily available resources posted on the web and we leverage these extensively. I would encourage you to review these resources in your analytics journey. Some that we specifically use with great frequency are these (and I say loud \textbf{THANK YOU} to the authors!):

\section{Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}\label{course-objectives-and-learning-outcomes}}

This course is designed to introduce to data science. Students will apply statistical knowledge and techniques to both business and non-business contexts.

At the end of this course students should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Demonstrate mastery of the statistical software in R and the Rstudio IDE.
\item
  Data wrangle (the process of cleaning and unifying messy and complex data sets for easy access and analysis)
\item
  Demonstrate mastery of single and multiple regression.
\item
  Demonstrate mastery of these dplyr functions: filter, select, mutate, group\_by, summaize, and tally.
\item
  Demonstrate mastery of how business analytics is related to other business functions and is important to the success of the business entity.
\end{itemize}

This course will be focused on both understanding and applying key business analytical concepts. Although the text serves as a useful foundation for the concepts covered in the class, simple memorization of the material in the text will not be sufficient. Class participation, discussion, and application are critical.

\hypertarget{class-participation}{%
\section{Class Participation:}\label{class-participation}}

I will frequently give readings or assignments for you to complete prior to the next class meeting. I expect you to fully engage the material: answer questions, pose questions, provide insightful observations. Keep in mind that quality is an important component in ``participation.'' Periodic cold calls will take place. I will also put students in the ``hot seat'' on occasion. In these class sessions, I may select a random group of students to lead us in the discussion and debate. Because the selection of participants will not be announced until class begins, everyone will be expected to prepare for the discussion. Reading the assigned chapters and articles are the best way to prepare for the discussion. If you have concerns about being called on in class, please see me to discuss. The purpose of the ``hot seat'' is not to stress or embarrass students, but to encourage students to actively engage the material.

\hypertarget{phones}{%
\section{Phones}\label{phones}}

\textbf{Phones are not allowed to be used in class without the instructor's prior consent.} If you have a need of a phone during class please let me know before class. Unauthorized use of electronic devices may result in the lowering of the grade or dismissal from the class. \textbf{I mean this.}

\textbf{The phone thing? I mean this.}

\hypertarget{attendance}{%
\section{Attendance}\label{attendance}}

You are expected to be regular and punctual in your class attendance. Students are responsible for all the material missed and homework assignments made. If class is missed, notes/homework should be obtained from another student. If I am more than 15 minutes late, class is considered cancelled. No more than 4 absences are allowed during a semester. Exceeding the absence policy may result in receiving an F for the course. The professors roll is the official roll and students not present when roll is taken will be counted as absent. If a student must miss an exam, she or he must work out an agreeable time with the instructor to take the test prior to the exam being given. If a student misses a test due to an emergency, the student must inform the instructor as soon as is possible. In special cases, the instructor may allow the student to take a make-up exam.

Additionally, it is the student's responsibility to give the instructor one week's notice prior to each instance where accommodation will be required.

\hypertarget{honor-code-and-plagiarism}{%
\section{Honor Code and Plagiarism:}\label{honor-code-and-plagiarism}}

All assignments/exams must be your own work. Any copying or use of unauthorized assistance will be treated as a violation of PC's Honor Code. If you are unsure of what resources are allowed, please ask. Please note that all text longer than 7 words taken from ANY other source must be placed in quotations and cited. Also, summarizing ANY other source must also be cited. Using ANY other source and showing work to be your own is a violation of plagiarism and the honor code.

Launch RStudio/R.

You will first intall R and then. RStudio.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{section}{%
\section{}\label{section}}

\href{http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/images/rstudio.png}{Rstudio Console}

FYI: you can change the default location of the panes, among many other things: \href{https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-the-RStudio-IDE}{Customizing RStudio}.

Go into the Console, where we interact with the live R process.

You can make an object by assigning a value or statement to a letter or string. We use \texttt{\textless{}-} to assign objects meaning. Create and inspect the following object:

\textbf{Your first analysis in R:}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{3} \SpecialCharTok{*} \DecValTok{4}
\NormalTok{x}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 12}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

All R statements where you create objects -- ``assignments'' -- have this form:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{objectName }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ value}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and in my head I hear, e.g., ``x gets 12''.

You will make lots of assignments and the operator \texttt{\textless{}-} is a pain to type. Don't be lazy and use \texttt{=}, although it would work, because it will just sow confusion later. Instead, utilize RStudio's keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign).

\textbf{I want to be your friend. As a friend, I implore you, learn this:}

\begin{quote}
In RStudio insert the \textless- assignment operator with Option + - (the minus sign)on a Mac, or Alt + - (the minus sign) on Windows.
\end{quote}

Notice that RStudio automatically surrounds \texttt{\textless{}-} with spaces, which demonstrates a useful code formatting practice. Code is miserable to read on a good day. Give your eyes a break and use spaces.

RStudio offers many handy \href{https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE}{RStudio Quick keys}. Also, Alt+Shift+K brings up a keyboard shortcut reference card.

Object names cannot start with a digit and cannot contain certain other characters such as a comma or a space. You will be wise to adopt a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case}{convention for demarcating words} in names, but note that best practice is to choose ONE convention and stay true to it throughout your code.

\begin{verbatim}
i_use_snake_case
other.people.use.periods
evenOthersUseCamelCase
\end{verbatim}

Make another assignment:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{this\_is\_a\_really\_long\_name }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FloatTok{2.5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To inspect this, try out RStudio's completion facility: type the first few characters, press TAB, add characters until you disambiguate, then press return.

Make another assignment:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{turner\_rocks }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{2} \SpecialCharTok{\^{}} \DecValTok{3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When making assignments, it is best practice to keep the names brief, yet descriptive. For instance, while the name ``this\_is\_a\_really\_long\_name'' is accurate, so is ``long\_name'' and this is much more intuitive and easy to read/type over and over.

Let's try to inspect:

\begin{Shaded}

\textbf{Implicit contract with the computer / scripting language: Computer will do tedious computation for you. In return, you will be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters. Get better at typing.}

R has a mind-blowing collection of built-in functions that are accessed like so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{functionName}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{arg1 =}\NormalTok{ val1, }\AttributeTok{arg2 =}\NormalTok{ val2, and so on)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's try using \texttt{seq()} which makes regular sequences of numbers and, while we're at it, demo more helpful features of RStudio.

Type \texttt{se} and hit TAB. A pop up shows you possible completions. Specify \texttt{seq()} by typing more to disambiguate or using the up/down arrows to select. Notice the floating tool-tip-type help that pops up, reminding you of a function's arguments. If you want even more help, press F1 as directed to get the full documentation in the help tab of the lower right pane. Now open the parentheses and notice the automatic addition of the closing parenthesis and the placement of cursor in the middle. Type the arguments \texttt{1,\ 10} and hit return. RStudio also exits the parenthetical expression for you. IDEs are great.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The above also demonstrates something about how R resolves function arguments. You can always specify in \texttt{name\ =\ value} form. But if you do not, R attempts to resolve by position. So above, it is assumed that we want a sequence \texttt{from\ =\ 1} that goes \texttt{to\ =\ 10}. Since we didn't specify step size, the default value of \texttt{by} in the function definition is used, which ends up being 1 in this case. For functions I call often, I might use this resolve by position for the first
argument or maybe the first two. After that, I always use \texttt{name\ =\ value}.

Make this assignment and notice similar help with quotation marks.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{yo }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"hello world"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you just make an assignment, you don't get to see the value, so then you're tempted to immediately inspect.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{y}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This common action can be shortened by surrounding the assignment with parentheses, which causes assignment and ``print to screen'' to happen.

It is best practice to always attempt to ``print'' your assignments after creating them. This will help leviate the issue of searching 200+ lines of code for that one error causing argument.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(y }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{))}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Not all functions have (or require) arguments:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{date}\NormalTok{()}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] "Mon Dec 19 07:40:50 2022"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now look at your workspace -- in the upper right pane. The workspace is where user-defined objects accumulate. You can also get a listing of these objects with commands:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{objects}\NormalTok{()}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] "this\_is\_a\_really\_long\_name"}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2] "turner\_rocks"              }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [3] "x"                         }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [4] "y"                         }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [5] "yo"}
\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{()}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] "this\_is\_a\_really\_long\_name"}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2] "turner\_rocks"              }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [3] "x"                         }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [4] "y"                         }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [5] "yo"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you want to remove the object named \texttt{y}, you can do this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rm}\NormalTok{(y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To remove everything:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rm}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{list =} \FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{())}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or click the broom in RStudio's Environment pane.

\hypertarget{workspace-and-working-directory}{%
\section{Workspace and working directory}\label{workspace-and-working-directory}}

One day you will need to quit R, go do something else and return to your analysis later (this is a very happy day).

One day you will have multiple analyses going that use R and you want to keep them separate (a not so happy day).

One day you will need to bring data from the outside world into R and send numerical results and figures from R back out into the world (the happiest of days).

To handle these real life situations, you need to make two decisions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What about your analysis is ``real'', i.e.~will you save it as your lasting record of what happened?
\item
  Where does your analysis ``live''?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{workspace-.rdata}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Workspace, \texttt{.RData}}{Workspace, .RData}}\label{workspace-.rdata}}

As a beginning R user, it's OK to consider your workspace ``real''. \emph{Very soon}, I urge you to evolve to the next level, where you consider your saved R scripts as ``real''. (In either case, of course the input data is very much real and requires preservation!) With the input data and the R code you used, you can reproduce
\emph{everything}. You can make your analysis fancier. You can get to the bottom of puzzling results and discover and fix bugs in your code. You can reuse the code to conduct similar analyses in new projects. You can remake a figure with different aspect ratio or save is as TIFF instead of PDF. You are ready to take questions. You are ready for the future.

If you regard your workspace as ``real'' (saving and reloading all the time), if you need to redo analysis \ldots{} you're going to either redo a lot of typing (making mistakes all the way) or will have to mine your R history for the commands you used. Rather than {[}becoming an expert on managing the R history{]}{[}rstudio-command-history{]}, a better use of your time and psychic energy is to keep your ``good'' R code in a script for future reuse.

Because it can be useful sometimes, note the commands you've recently run appear in the History pane.

But you don't have to choose right now and the two strategies are not incompatible. Let's demo the save / reload the workspace approach.

Upon quitting R, you have to decide if you want to save your workspace, for potential restoration the next time you launch R. Depending on your set up, R or your IDE, e.g.~RStudio, will probably prompt you to make this decision.

Quit R/RStudio, either from the menu, using a keyboard shortcut, or by typing \texttt{q()} in the Console. You'll get a prompt like this:

\begin{quote}
Save workspace image to \textasciitilde/.Rdata?
\end{quote}

\emph{Note where the workspace image is to be saved} and then click ``Save''.

Using your favorite method, visit the directory where image was saved and verify there is a file named \texttt{.RData}. You will also see a file \texttt{.Rhistory}, holding the commands submitted in your recent session.

Restart RStudio. In the Console you will see a line like this:

\begin{verbatim}
[Workspace loaded from ~/.RData]
\end{verbatim}

indicating that your workspace has been restored. Look in the Workspace pane and you'll see the same objects as before. In the History tab of the same pane, you should also see your command history. You're back in business. This way of starting and stopping analytical work will not serve you well for long but it's a start.

\hypertarget{working-directory}{%
\subsection{Working directory}\label{working-directory}}

Any process running on your computer has a notion of its ``working directory''. In R, this is where R will look, by default, for files you ask it to load. It also where, by default, any files you write to disk will go. Chances are your current working directory is the directory we inspected above, i.e.~the one where RStudio wanted to save the workspace.

You can explicitly check your working directory with:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{getwd}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It is also displayed at the top of the RStudio console.

As a beginning R user, it's OK let your home directory or any other weird directory on your computer be R's working directory. \emph{Very soon}, I urge you to evolve to the next level, where you organize your analytical projects into directories and, when working on project A, set R's working directory to the associated directory.

\textbf{Although I do not recommend it}, in case you're curious, you can set R's working directory at the command line like so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{setwd}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"\textasciitilde{}/myCoolProject"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Although I do not recommend it}, you can also use RStudio's Files pane to navigate to a directory and then set it as working directory from the menu: \emph{Session \textgreater{} Set Working Directory \textgreater{} To Files Pane Location}. (You'll see even more options there). Or within the Files pane, choose ``More'' and ``Set As Working Directory''.

But there's a better way. A way that also puts you on the path to managing your R work like an expert.

\hypertarget{objects-and-arithmetic}{%
\chapter{Objects and Arithmetic}\label{objects-and-arithmetic}}

\hypertarget{introduction-1}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

R stores information and operates on objects. The simplest objects are scalars, vectors and matrices.
But there are many others: lists and dataframes for example. In advanced use of R it can also be
useful to define new types of object, specific for particular application. We will stick with just the
most commonly used objects here.
An important feature of R is that it will do different things on different types of objects. For
example, type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{4}\SpecialCharTok{+}\DecValTok{6}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

So, R does scalar arithmetic returning the scalar value 10. (In actual fact, R returns a vector of
length 1 - hence the {[}1{]} denoting first element of the vector.
We can assign objects values for subsequent use. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\DecValTok{6}
\NormalTok{y}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\DecValTok{4}
\NormalTok{z}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{x}\SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

would do the same calculation as above, storing the result in an object called z. We can look at
the contents of the object by simply typing its name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{z}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Storing things such as calculations as objects is extremely useful, especially in longer scripts. Mainly because you will likely call the same equation multiple times and if you need to revise it in any way you only need to change the initial assignment rather than every line.

\hypertarget{basic-functions}{%
\section{Basic Functions}\label{basic-functions}}

At any time we can list the objects which we have created:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{()}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] "x" "y" "z"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Notice that ls is actually an object itself. Typing ls would result in a display of the contents of
this object, in this case, the commands of the function. The use of parentheses, ls(), ensures that
the function is executed and its result - in this case, a list of the objects in the directory - displayed.
More commonly a function will operate on an object, for example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sqrt}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{16}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

calculates the square root of 16. Objects can be removed from the current workspace with the rm
function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rm}\NormalTok{(x,y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

for example.

There are many standard functions available in R, and it is also possible to create new ones.
Vectors can be created in R in a number of ways. We can describe all of the elements:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{z}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note the use of the function c to concatenate or glue together individual elements. This function
can be used much more widely, for example

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{y}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{z}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(x,y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

would lead to the same result by gluing together two vectors to create a single vector.

Sequences can be generated as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

while more general sequences can be generated using the seq command. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{,}\AttributeTok{by=}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 1 3 5 7 9}
\FunctionTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{,}\AttributeTok{length=}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1]  8.0 10.4 12.8 15.2 17.6 20.0}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

These examples illustrate that many functions in R have optional arguments, in this case, either the step length or the total length of the sequence (it doesn't make sense to use both). If you leave out both of these options, R will make its own default choice, in this case assuming a step length
of 1. So, for example,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{,}\AttributeTok{length=}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1]  8.0 10.4 12.8 15.2 17.6 20.0}
\NormalTok{x}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{x}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

also generates a vector of integers from 1 to 10.

At this point it's worth mentioning the help facility. If you don't know how to use a function,
or don't know what the options or default values are, type help(functionname) where functionname is the name of the function you are interested in. This will usually help and will often include examples to make things even clearer.

Another useful function for building vectors is the rep command for repeating things. For
example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rep}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}   [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}  [28] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}  [55] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}  [82] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}
\FunctionTok{rep}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}  [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3}
\FunctionTok{rep}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{))}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}  [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

which we could also simplify cleverly as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rep}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\FunctionTok{rep}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{))}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}  [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As explained above, R will often adapt to the objects it is asked to work on. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{y}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{x}\SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{y}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1]  7 10 13}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x}\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{y}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1]  6 16 36}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

showing that R uses componentwise arithmetic on vectors. R will also try to make sense if objects
are mixed. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{x}\SpecialCharTok{+}\DecValTok{2}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1]  8 10 11}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

though care should be taken to make sure that R is doing what you would like it to in these circumstances.

Two particularly useful functions worth remembering are length which returns the length of a vector (i.e.~the number of elements it contains) and sum which calculates the sum of the elements of a vector.

\hypertarget{statistics-and-summaries}{%
\section{Statistics and Summaries}\label{statistics-and-summaries}}

One of the most useful functions of R is its ability to perform statistical analysis on large pieces of data. Later in this book we will cover how this analysis can be used to build complex models and test their accuracy. For now, the focus will be on how to perform basic statistical analysis and the definitions of the more basic terms.

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsection{Statistical Analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

You've undoubtedly have heard the terms mean, median, standard deviation and variance. However, if asked to define these terms and provide examples of their usefulness, what would you say? This section is going to answer the first part of that question.

Mean is a pretty straight forward concept for most. Commonly referred to as the ``average'', you find this number by adding all the numbers in your data set together and then divide by the total number of points you used. This is easily done on a calculator if you are working with less then 20 digits, however this is almost never the case in data science. Often, especially with R, you will be dealing with data sets with hundreds, thousands, or maybe even hundreds of thousands of data points. Fortunately, R takes the pain away from this process and offers a very simple function that will do this for you. Start by creating an object that contains a list of numbers, and then simply use the mean function to calculate the average of your variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{3.8}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{3.1}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{2.1}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{12.6}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{8.43}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{11}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{)}

\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(a)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 6.037857}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The median of a data set is data point that fall in the middle of all the other points when they are ordered from lowest to highest. Again, something easily found even without a calculator if you have small data sets, however humans can miscount and some data sets are just too massive for us to do on our own. R never makes these counting mistakes and by using a simple function you save yourself hours of mundane counting. Start the same way you found mean by creating an object with various numbers and then simply use the \texttt{median} function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{b }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{3.8}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{3.1}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{2.1}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{12.6}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{8.43}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{11}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{)}

\FunctionTok{median}\NormalTok{(b)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 3.9}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Many people have heard of standard deviation, but not many can provide an accurate definition. Standard deviation is the measure of variance (see next paragraph) between numbers in a data set and that data set's mean. Typically a lower standard deviation is what you want to see as this proves there is little variance in your data set and that typically means a higher correlation. If you wanted to find this by hand you would have to find the square root of the variance between each point and the mean. This is easy if you have all the numbers you need, but that is almost never the case and thus you would have to calculate all that variance by hand and that is too much work. Why take all those extra steps when R can do it for you? The \texttt{sd()} function does all the work without any hassle, all you have to do is identify the object you want it to find the standard deviation of.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{d }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{3.8}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{3.1}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{2.1}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{12.6}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{17}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{8.43}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{11}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{)}

\FunctionTok{sd}\NormalTok{(d)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 4.821066}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Finally, we can cover variance. Variance is the measure of distance between two numbers. This statistic is often used to measure how spread out your data is and can be used to determine your model's accuracy. Typically, a higher variance means your model is inaccurate. So, when building models and reviewing your summary statistics, you want your variance to be as low as possible. There is a var() function that will find the variance of a variable for you, however typically you will create a confusion matrix (discussed in a later section) that will help you determine the variance, and thus accuracy of your model.

Let's suppose we've collected some data from an experiment and stored them in an object x:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{7.5}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{8.2}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{3.1}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{5.6}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{8.2}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{9.3}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{6.5}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{7.0}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{9.3}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{1.2}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{14.5}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{6.2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Some simple summary statistics of these data can be produced:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(x)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 7.216667}
\FunctionTok{var}\NormalTok{(x)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 11.00879}
\FunctionTok{sd}\NormalTok{(x)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 3.317949}
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(x)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}   1.200   6.050   7.250   7.217   8.475  14.500}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

which should all be self explanatory.

It may be, however, that we subsequently learn that the first 6 data points correspond to measurements made on one machine, and the second six on another machine.

This might lead us to want to summarize the two sets of data separately, so we would need to extract from
x the two relevant subvectors. This is achieved by subscripting:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x[}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 7.5 8.2 3.1 5.6 8.2 9.3}
\NormalTok{x[}\DecValTok{7}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1]  6.5  7.0  9.3  1.2 14.5  6.2}
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(x[}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{])}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}   3.100   6.075   7.850   6.983   8.200   9.300}
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(x[}\DecValTok{7}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{])}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}   1.200   6.275   6.750   7.450   8.725  14.500}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Other subsets can be created in the obvious way. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x[}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{)]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 8.2 5.6 9.3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Negative integers can be used to exclude particular elements. For example

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x[}\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{)]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1]  6.5  7.0  9.3  1.2 14.5  6.2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

has the same effect as

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x[}\DecValTok{7}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1]  6.5  7.0  9.3  1.2 14.5  6.2}

\hypertarget{cbind-and-rbind}{%
\section{CBind and RBind}\label{cbind-and-rbind}}

Matrices can be created in R in a variety of ways. Perhaps the simplest is to create the columns (just a couple of objects) and then glue them together with the command cbind. For example,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{y}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{z}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{cbind}\NormalTok{(x,y)}
\NormalTok{z}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      x y}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1,] 5 6}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2,] 7 3}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [3,] 9 4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The dimension of a matrix can be checked with the dim command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{dim}\NormalTok{(z)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 3 2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

{[}1{]} 3 2 i.e., three rows and two columns. There is a similar command, rbind, for building matrices by gluing rows together.

The functions cbind and rbind can also be applied to matrices themselves (provided the dimensions match) to form larger matrices. For example,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rbind}\NormalTok{(z,z)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      x y}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1,] 5 6}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2,] 7 3}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [3,] 9 4}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [4,] 5 6}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [5,] 7 3}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [6,] 9 4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Create a matrix made up of two columns showing the GPAs and number of hours studied by seven students.
\item
  Recreate the following matrix in R:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
#>      x   y
#> [1,] 5 3.4
#> [2,] 7 4.0
#> [3,] 2 2.5
#> [4,] 3 3.2
#> [5,] 8 2.8
#> [6,] 4 3.1
#> [7,] 2 3.6
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Using the appropriate function, combine the two matrices you created above.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{matrix-function}{%
\section{Matrix Function}\label{matrix-function}}

Matrices can also be built by explicit construction via the function matrix. For example,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{z}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{matrix}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{),}\AttributeTok{nrow=}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

results in a matrix z identical to z above. Notice that the dimension of the matrix is determined by the size of the vector and the requirement that the number of rows is 3, as specified by the argument nrow=3. As an alternative we could have specified the number of columns with the argument ncol=2 (obviously, it is unnecessary to give both). Notice that the matrix is `flled up' column-wise. If instead you wish to fill up row-wise, add the option byrow=T. For example,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{z}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{matrix}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{),}\AttributeTok{nr=}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\AttributeTok{byrow=}\NormalTok{T)}
\NormalTok{z}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      [,1] [,2]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1,]    5    7}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2,]    9    6}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [3,]    3    4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Notice that the argument nrow has been abbreviated to nr. Such abbreviations are always possible for function arguments provided it induces no ambiguity - if in doubt always use the full argument name.

As usual, R will try to interpret operations on matrices in a natural way. For example, with z as above, and

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{matrix}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{),}\AttributeTok{nrow=}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\AttributeTok{byrow=}\NormalTok{T)}
\NormalTok{y}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      [,1] [,2]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1,]    1    3}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2,]    0    9}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [3,]    5   {-}1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

we obtain

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y}\SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{z}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      [,1] [,2]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1,]    6   10}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2,]    9   15}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [3,]    8    3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y}\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{z}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      [,1] [,2]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1,]    5   21}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2,]    0   54}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [3,]   15   {-}4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Other useful functions on matrices are to transpose a matrix:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{z}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      [,1] [,2]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1,]    5    7}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2,]    9    6}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [3,]    3    4}
\FunctionTok{t}\NormalTok{(z)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      [,1] [,2] [,3]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1,]    5    9    3}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2,]    7    6    4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As with vectors it is useful to be able to extract sub-components of matrices. In this case, wemay wish to pick out individual elements, rows or columns. As before, the {[} {]} notation is used to subscript. The following examples should make things clear:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{z[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{z[}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{),}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 6 4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{z[,}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 7 6 4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{quote}
\end{quote}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{z[}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      [,1] [,2]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1,]    5    7}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2,]    9    6}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

So, in particular, it is necessary to specify which rows and columns are required, whilst omitting
the integer for either dimension implies that every element in that dimension is selected.

Have we talked about the Target Pregnancy Story yet?

\textbf{How Target Figured Out A Teen Girl Was Pregnant Before Her Father Did}

This is where the fun stuff begins! What we have learned up to this point has barely scratched the surface of what R is capable of. In the world of data science, R is used for three primary purposes, those purposes are \textbf{(1) data transformation, (2) data wrangling, (3) machine learning}. The other two purposes have been covered in earlier chapters of this book. The reason we covered the other topics first is that that lay the foundation. In the real world, it is likely you will never be given a clean data set, and you will have to do some wrangling and transformation before anything else is possible. After all, in the experience of many data science students, cleaning the data is the most tedious and time consuming process of a project.

Enough of the old stuff, what is machine learning? According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, machine learning is ``the process by which a computer is able to improve its own performance by continuously incorporating new data into an existing statistical model.'' Let's take a trip back to the Target story discussed in the introductory chapter. The data scientist, or more likely data scientists (collaborative work is essential in this field), that worked on that model were likely experts in machine learning. They were able to train the computer to look through thousands (probably more) of customers' data and the computer, based off the algorithms written by these ``data nerds,'' was able to predict whether a customer was pregnant! Think of other possible applications of this technology? We could predict how well a student will preform on an exam, the risk of someone suffering from a heart attack, or the likelihood that someone will default on a loan. Every field in existence today could find a way to implement machine learning to optimize their business.

There are two branches of machine learning, supervised and unsupervised. Both have their own unique uses, however in this course we will focus on supervised machine learning. Supervised machine learning required us to provide a clean data set with clearly defined variables and instructions. Essentially, we give the computer the information it needs and provide it with specific instructions detailing what we would like to see happen, and it does the rest. Linear regression is typically the first method of supervised learning people are introduced to, and it will be the focus of this chapter.

Note, these concepts are not all common sense and can be difficult to wrap your head around at times. Be sure to constantly turn to your instructor or peers for assistance and remember that there are hundreds of online resources at your disposal. As with anything though, practice makes perfect. The popular rule states that mastering a skill can take upwards of 10,000 hours! Now, this course is not going to take you 10 years to complete, however the goal is that by the end of this chapter you will know your way around the basics of linear regression.

Let's chat about why understaning linear regression is so important.
\end{quote}

\textbf{While there may always seem to be something new, cool, and shiny in the field of AI/ML, classic statistical methods that leverage machine learning techniques remain powerful and practical for solving many real-world business problems.}

Let's look at a very simple model first. For this example, we will need to import the Introduction to Statistical Learning package (ISLR). We will use the ``credit'' data set that is part of the ISLR package.

lm is the function we use to create linear regression models. Now, before we discuss interpreting the results we get from this function, we will discuss the different parts of the model. The ``\textasciitilde{}'' symbol is the key to this entire equation. We are telling R to predict whatever is on the left side of the tilde using the variables on the right.

There is a lot of statistical jargon included in our summary that may be unfamiliar to those who have not taken statistics before. That is okay, however, because we are going to breakdown the main statistics we are interested in. Let's start with our variables and their significance in the model.

\hypertarget{p-values}{%
\subsection{P-Values}\label{p-values}}

The p-value of our model helps us either prove or disprove the null-hypothesis of our test. In the case of this class, the null-hypothesis is that there is no relationship between the variables we are using to make the predictions and the actual variable we are predicting. In other words, the smaller our p-value the higher the level of significance there is between our variables. When we run a summary of our linear regression model we are give multiple p-values.

First, under coefficients, they are listed for each variable. This can help us optimize our model because we can see what variables are helping make the model more accurate versus those that may be hindering its performance. Also notice the asterisks next to our p-values. R kindly puts up to three stars next to each variable to help us visually tell if they are significant, essentially more stars means a lower p-value and thus a higher correlation.
The second place we see a p-value is at the bottom of our summary. This p-value will give us the overall correlation that exists in our model. As we see in this case, our p-values for this model is \textless{} .00000000000000022, that is a tiny number and frankly a great p-value. Typically we want our p-value to be .05 or smaller. A p-value of .05 tells us that we have a confidence level of 95\%.

\hypertarget{multiple-r-squared}{%
\subsection{Multiple R-Squared}\label{multiple-r-squared}}

R-squared tells us how well our model explains the variance in our variable. In other words, is the reason for the change in the independent variable actually due to our model's prediction? The higher the r-squared, the more accurate our model is because the better the data fits it. The maximum value r-squared can be is 1.

In our model's case, we have a multiple r-squared of .743, this means our model is approximately 74.3\% accurate as this is the amount of variance in the data caused by our dependent variable. Our r-squared could certainly be better. In fact, in the real world you typically are aiming for an r-squared above .9 or .95, which means you would have 90\%-95\% accuracy.

\hypertarget{applying-the-model-to-make-predictions}{%
\section{Applying the Model to Make Predictions}\label{applying-the-model-to-make-predictions}}

This type of regression is refereed to as linear for a reason. If we were to visualize our model on a quadratic plane, we would see a line of best fit that would travel along through our data. This means we can simplify the model to fit the slope-intercept equation:

y = m(x)+b

In our case the slope of our line is related to the independent variables. The sum of these slopes will give us the overall slope of our line and the intercept is provided by the equation summary. If we modify this equation to be more applicable to our situation we would get something like this:

y = m1x1 + m2x2 \ldots{} + b

Let's look back at our example model from before

We see that our limit variable has an estimate of 1.718e-01, this is our slope. When dealing with quantitative variables, we simply multiply our slope by the intended independent variable. So, if we wanted to find the balance of someone with a limit of 400, we would multiply 1.718e-01 by 400.

With the qualitative variables, in this case ethnicity, we multiply the estimate of the TRUE values by 1 and FALSE values by 0, thus cancelling the FALSE values out.

Let's look at an example. If we used our above equation to predict the balance of someone who was Caucasian and has a credit limit of 500, here is the equation we would set up:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

So, according to our model our customer would have a balance of -208.09. This number may seem funny, but keep in mind that our r-squared was not the best for this model making it inaccurate and the ethnicity of the customer was not highly correlated with the balance. Both of these facts may cause our prediction to be off. If we were actually creating a model that could predict balance, we would want to look at some of the more correlated variables in the data set.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, and fount of all knowledge
\end{quote}

R packages are extensions to the R statistical programming language. R packages contain code, data, and documentation in a standardised collection format that can be installed by users of R, typically via a centralised software repository such as CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network).

The large number of packages available for R, and the ease of installing and using them, has been cited as a major factor in driving the widespread adoption of the language in data science.

\hypertarget{single-table-verbs}{%
\section{Single table verbs}\label{single-table-verbs}}

\texttt{dplyr} aims to provide a function for each basic verb of data manipulation. These verbs can be organised into three categories based on the component of the dataset that they work with:

Rows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{filter()} chooses rows based on column values.
\item
  \texttt{slice()} chooses rows based on location.
\item
  \texttt{arrange()} changes the order of the rows.
\end{itemize}

Columns:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{select()} changes whether or not a column is included.
\item
  \texttt{rename()} changes the name of columns.
  \texttt{mutate()} changes the values of columns and creates new columns.
\item
  \texttt{relocate()} changes the order of the columns.
  Groups of rows:
\item
  \texttt{summarise()} collapses a group into a single row. It's not that useful until we learn the \texttt{group\_by()} verb below.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-pipe}{%
\section{The pipe}\label{the-pipe}}

All of the \texttt{dplyr} functions take a data frame (or tibble) as the first argument. You can use the pipe to rewrite multiple operations that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom (reading the pipe operator as ``then'').

\section{Creating data frames: data\_frame}\label{creating-data-frames-data_frame}}

\texttt{data\_frame()} is a better way than \texttt{data.frame()} for creating data frames. Benefits of \texttt{data\_frame()}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You can use previously defined columns to compute new columns.
\item
  It never coerces column types.
\item
  It never munges column names.
\item
  It never adds row names.
\item
  It only recycles length 1 input.
\item
  It returns a local data frame (a tbl\_df).

Please make sure you can load and use the NFL data. You can get the data from:

\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016?resource=download}

I have also put the data on Brightspace if that helps you.

For Friday, please try to answer these questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Which game had the most plays?\\
\item
  How many plays?
\item
  Which teams played in this game?\\
\item
  How many plays if you remove the ``No Play'' plays?
\item
  Highest scoring game (total points including both teams)?\\
\item
  How many plays were in this game?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{additional-practice}{%

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Create a new small data set called \texttt{small} that only uses game\_id's that are less than 2010000000 and the variables game\_id, home\_team, total\_home\_score, away\_team, total\_away\_score, and play\_type. How many rows do you get in this data set? I get 41,880.
\item
  How many plays are in the game 2009111507? I get 167.
\item
  For \texttt{small} how many plays are kick offs? I get 2327.
\item
  For game 2009111507 how many plays are kick offs? I get 10.
\item
  For \texttt{small} how many plays are qb kneels or qb spikes? I get 425.
\item
  For \texttt{small} how many what is the percentage of run to pass plays excluding all other types of plays? I get 43.15482\% running.
\item
  In small, which game has the most passing plays? I get game 2009122006 with 101 passing plays.

  Calculate the mean bill length and bill depth for each of the three species of penguins in once step (not three different calculations). Do these statistics line up with what you see in the penguins plot below?
\item
  Consider a new metric called \texttt{bill\_size} that's the sum of the length and depth. What is the average bill size and it's standard deviation among each species, broken out among each of the islands? (that is, nine pairs of statistics) Sort your resulting data frame in decreasing order by average bill size.
\item
  Answer in words (after you have the numerical answers):
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Which island has the biggest penguins?
\item
  Which penguins species are the biggest?
\item
  Does the size of a penguin depend on the island it lives on?\\
\item
  Does the size of each species of penguin depend on the island it lives on?\\
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a linear model using bill depth and bill depth to predict body mass. What would you predict for a penguin with bill length of 50 mm and a bill depth of 23 mm? What about a Gentoo with the same bill dimensions?
\item
  Create the plot below (or very similar). \emph{FYI, in case these questions are in black and white, each penguin species should be a different color in the plot.}
