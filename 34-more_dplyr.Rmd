# `dplyr` and `nycflights13`

```{r}
# load packages
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
library(nycflights13)

# print the flights dataset from nycflights13
head(flights)
```


## Choosing columns: select, rename

```{r}
# besides just using select() to pick columns...
flights %>% select(carrier, flight)

# ...you can use the minus sign to hide columns
flights %>% select(-month, -day)
```

```{r results='hide'}
# hide a range of columns
flights %>% select(-(dep_time:arr_delay))

# hide any column with a matching name
flights %>% select(-contains("time"))
```

```{r}
# pick columns using a character vector of column names
cols <- c("carrier", "flight", "tailnum")
flights %>% select(one_of(cols))
```

```{r}
# select() can be used to rename columns, though all columns not mentioned are dropped
flights %>% select(tail = tailnum)

# rename() does the same thing, except all columns not mentioned are kept
flights %>% rename(tail = tailnum)
```


## Choosing rows: filter, between, slice, sample_n, top_n, distinct

```{r}
# filter() supports the use of multiple conditions
flights %>% filter(dep_time >= 600, dep_time <= 605)
```

```{r results='hide'}
# between() is a concise alternative for determing if numeric values fall in a range
flights %>% filter(between(dep_time, 600, 605))

# side note: is.na() can also be useful when filtering
flights %>% filter(!is.na(dep_time))
```


```{r}
# slice() filters rows by position
flights %>% slice(1000:1005)

# keep the first three rows within each group
flights %>% group_by(month, day) %>% slice(1:3)

# sample three rows from each group
flights %>% group_by(month, day) %>% sample_n(3)

# keep three rows from each group with the top dep_delay
flights %>% group_by(month, day) %>% top_n(3, dep_delay)

# also sort by dep_delay within each group
flights %>% group_by(month, day) %>% top_n(3, dep_delay) %>% arrange(desc(dep_delay))
```


```{r}
# unique rows can be identified using unique() from base R
flights %>% select(origin, dest) %>% unique()
```

```{r results='hide'}
# dplyr provides an alternative that is more "efficient"
flights %>% select(origin, dest) %>% distinct()

# side note: when chaining, you don't have to include the parentheses if there are no arguments
flights %>% select(origin, dest) %>% distinct
```

## Excercies

Using the nycflights13 dataset and the dplyr package, answer these questions.  Some answers are given in square brackets for you to check your answers.

1. How many flights in Sept were late departing flights? [7815]
2. How many flights in Sept were late departing flights that originated at JFK airport? [2649]
3. How many flights in Sept were late departing flights with an origin of JFK airport and had an destination of anywhere except MIA? [2572]
4. Which carrier had the most flights in this data set?  [UA with 58665]
5. Which destination had the most flights in this data set? [ORD with 17283]
6. Which destination had the most flights with departure delays of greater than 60 minutes in this data set? [ORD with 1480]
7. What was the longest arrival delay in this dataset? [1272]
8. Which carrier in September had the most late departing flights? [UA with 1559]
9. Create a variable called total.annoyance which arrival delay plus the departure delay for each flight.
10. Which carrier with more than 10 flights in September had greatest % late departing flights? 


## Adding new variables: mutate, transmute, add_rownames

```{r}
# mutate() creates a new variable (and keeps all existing variables)
flights %>% mutate(speed = distance/air_time*60)

# transmute() only keeps the new variables
flights %>% transmute(speed = distance/air_time*60)
```


```{r}
# example data frame with row names
mtcars %>% head()

# add_rownames() turns row names into an explicit variable
mtcars %>% add_rownames("model") %>% head()

# side note: dplyr no longer prints row names (ever) for local data frames
mtcars %>% tbl_df()
```


## Grouping and counting: summarise, tally, count, group_size, n_groups, ungroup

```{r}
# summarise() can be used to count the number of rows in each group
flights %>% group_by(month) %>% summarise(cnt = n())
```

```{r results='hide'}
# tally() and count() can do this more concisely
flights %>% group_by(month) %>% tally()
flights %>% count(month)
```

```{r}
# you can sort by the count
flights %>% group_by(month) %>% summarise(cnt = n()) %>% arrange(desc(cnt))
```

```{r results='hide'}
# tally() and count() have a sort parameter for this purpose
flights %>% group_by(month) %>% tally(sort=TRUE)
flights %>% count(month, sort=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# you can sum over a specific variable instead of simply counting rows
flights %>% group_by(month) %>% summarise(dist = sum(distance))
```

```{r results='hide'}
# tally() and count() have a wt parameter for this purpose
flights %>% group_by(month) %>% tally(wt = distance)
flights %>% count(month, wt = distance)
```

```{r}
# group_size() returns the counts as a vector
flights %>% group_by(month) %>% group_size()

# n_groups() simply reports the number of groups
flights %>% group_by(month) %>% n_groups()
```

```{r}
# group by two variables, summarise, arrange (output is possibly confusing)
flights %>% group_by(month, day) %>% summarise(cnt = n()) %>% arrange(desc(cnt)) %>% print(n = 40)

# ungroup() before arranging to arrange across all groups
flights %>% group_by(month, day) %>% summarise(cnt = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% arrange(desc(cnt))
```


## Creating data frames: data_frame

`data_frame()` is a better way than `data.frame()` for creating data frames. Benefits of `data_frame()`:

* You can use previously defined columns to compute new columns.
* It never coerces column types.
* It never munges column names.
* It never adds row names. 
* It only recycles length 1 input.
* It returns a local data frame (a tbl_df).

```{r}
# data_frame() example
data_frame(a = 1:6, b = a*2, c = 'string', 'd+e' = 1) %>% glimpse()

# data.frame() example
data.frame(a = 1:6, c = 'string', 'd+e' = 1) %>% glimpse()
```

# Joining tables

## Joining (merging) tables: left_join, right_join, inner_join, full_join, semi_join, anti_join

```{r}
# create two simple data frames
(a <- data_frame(color = c("green","yellow","red"), num = 1:3))
(b <- data_frame(color = c("green","yellow","pink"), size = c("S","M","L")))

# only include observations found in both "a" and "b" (automatically joins on variables that appear in both tables)
inner_join(a, b)

# include observations found in either "a" or "b"
full_join(a, b)

# include all observations found in "a"
left_join(a, b)

# include all observations found in "b"
right_join(a, b)

# right_join(a, b) is identical to left_join(b, a) except for column ordering
left_join(b, a)

# filter "a" to only show observations that match "b"
semi_join(a, b)

# filter "a" to only show observations that don't match "b"
anti_join(a, b)
```


```{r}
# sometimes matching variables don't have identical names
b <- b %>% rename(col = color)

# specify that the join should occur by matching "color" in "a" with "col" in "b"
inner_join(a, b, by=c("color" = "col"))
```


## Viewing more output: print, View

```{r}
# specify that you want to see more rows
flights %>% print(n = 15)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# specify that you want to see ALL rows (don't run this!)
flights %>% print(n = Inf)
```

```{r}
# specify that you want to see all columns
flights %>% print(width = Inf)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# show up to 1000 rows and all columns
flights %>% View()

# set option to see all columns and fewer rows
options(dplyr.width = Inf, dplyr.print_min = 6)

# reset options (or just close R)
options(dplyr.width = NULL, dplyr.print_min = 10)
```
